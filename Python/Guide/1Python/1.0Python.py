'''Feature of Python Language
•	High-level language
Python allows you to write code closer to human language, abstracting away low-level details like memory management.
•	Easy syntax and readability
Python uses clean and simple syntax, making it easier to read, write, and maintain—especially for beginners.
•	Dynamically typed
You don't need to declare variable types explicitly; Python determines the type at runtime.
•	Large standard library
Python comes with a wide range of built-in modules and functions, so you can do more without installing extra tools.
•	Cross-platform compatibility
Python code can run on multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.

'''Common Uses of Python
•	Web Development
Python is used to build dynamic websites and web applications using frameworks like Django and Flask.
•	Data Science & Analysis
Popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib make Python a top choice for data analysis and visualization.
•	Machine Learning & AI
With tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, Python is widely used for training and deploying machine learning models.
•	Automation & Scripting
Python is perfect for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks such as file handling, web scraping, and system monitoring.
•	Game Development
Libraries like Pygame allow developers to create simple 2D games quickly.
•	Cybersecurity & Hacking Tools
Python is used to write tools for penetration testing, malware analysis, and automation in cybersecurity.
