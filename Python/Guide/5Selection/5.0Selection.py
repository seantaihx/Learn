If-else: Just like how we use in real life

if condition:
    statement
elif condition:
    statement
else:
    statement

!!!Multiple if will make the computer to check multiple time, while if elif else will only 
   make the computer to check till it's true.
i.e. if first condition is false, check second, if false again, check third till true.
