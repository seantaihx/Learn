#Condition
'''
Computer use boolean value to make decision
'''


#if-else statement
'''
If-else: Just like how we use in real life

format:
if condition:
    statement
elif condition:         #Only run when previous condition is false
    statement
else:                    #Only run when all previous condition is false
    statement

!!!Multiple if will make the computer to check multiple time, while if elif else will only 
   make the computer to check till it's true.
i.e. if first condition is false, check second, if false again, check third till true.
'''

#Matching
'''
Matching is similar to if-else statement, it's used when you know exactly what options there'll be

format:
match variable:
    case option1:
        statement
    case option2:
        statement
    case option3|option4|option4:
        statement
    case _:                                #For case that doesnt match any of the previous case
        statement
'''
