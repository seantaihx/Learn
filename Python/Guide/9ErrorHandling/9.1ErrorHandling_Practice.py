'''Explanation
This code implements a simple supermarket cart system using a Python dictionary to store items and their quantities, 
while demonstrating essential exception handling constructs (try, except, else, finally). 
It allows users to interactively add or remove items, check for item presence, 
and gracefully handles invalid inputs using built-in exceptions like ValueError, IndexError, TypeError, and NameError. 
The code also uses raise to enforce custom validation rules, such as preventing negative prices. 
Key features include input validation with isdigit(), use of .get() to safely retrieve values, 
and a finally block to ensure the cart's status is always shown, regardless of errors. 
This structure ensures the program remains robust and user-friendly while showcasing core Python 
error-handling and dictionary manipulation techniques.
