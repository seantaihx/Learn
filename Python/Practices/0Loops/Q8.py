You are building an access control system for a game.
    1.    Ask the user for their age.
    2.    Ask the user to choose an access level:
    •    1 = Teen Mode (age 13-17)
    •    2 = Adult Mode (18+)
    •    3 = Exit
    3.    Use match-case to process the selected mode.
    4.    Use if-else to check:
    •    If the user's age meets the requirement for that mode.
    •    If not, deny access.
    5.    Use isinstance() to verify the age is a number (you may need try-except if you want advanced validation).
    6.    Print the result and type of the output.
