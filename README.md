Although the repo is aimed to guide some beginners or to help memorise some of the functions or methods of the 
respective programming language, it initially is used just as a practice for me and also a reference. It could 
be used as a tutorial too but it does not clarify some of the function enough since my limited English can't 
express them well.

There is a practice, where the visitor can try to code it themselves according to the questions, the answer provided
are not the best, just some of the easy solution I'd figured out. If one can think of a better solution please don't hesitate
to pull an issue to provide the better solution.

I tried to be as beginner-friendly as possible in the practice, so it might not be too challenging for those who want to advance
their coding skills further. I only include some of the basic skills and showcase some of the characteristics of the methods
and functions. It is still recommended to search online if one wants to learn since i am not a pro-coder not to say a teacher.

Thank you.
